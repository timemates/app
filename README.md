# TimeMates App
TimeMates is a multiplatform application that is built with Kotlin, Compose,
 Coroutines, and RSocket (via [rsproto](https://github.com/timemates/rsproto)).
It is designed to help teams enhance their productivity by providing customizable timers,
 notes, and seamless integrations with other platforms like GitHub in the future.

Whether you are working on a team project or just tackling your own homework, TimeMates has everything you need to
stay organized, focused, and productive.
The app allows users to create personalized timers for their tasks,
so they can stay on track and meet deadlines.
