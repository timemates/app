/**
 * This is a convention that actually will make you able to write tests in `jvmTest` source set,
 * not in `commonTest`. We not always need to have common tests, at least, for example, for domain
 * & presentation logic (mvi) â€“ there's no need as it's not platform specific.
 *
 * So, basically, we will use mockk because it's much more easier to use comparing with `mockative`
 * or other ksp-based mocking libraries.
 *
 * Only known issue for now, it that it cannot mock suspend function that returns value class. It
 * also applies for class Result, so we're not going to use this class anywhere outside SDK (it
 * also is good approach as in business logic we want to mark specific errors to be checked).
